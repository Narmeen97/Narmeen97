👋 Hi, I’m Narmeen :) \
👀 I’m interested in research, data analysis, and visualization. \
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in data analysis and visualization. \
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects and continue to build my porfolio with various programming and analytical projects! \
📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/narmeen-mohammed-7ab320278/) \

⚡ Fun fact: My undergraduate research was featured in a published article, and I’m a co-author! 
🎨 In my spare time I enjoy being creative; painting, sculpting. I also have a side project going where I am starting my own press on nail business!
